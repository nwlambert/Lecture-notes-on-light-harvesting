# Lecture-notes-on-light-harvesting
An update on summer school lectures notes, prepared for an invited lecture at the University of Tokyo.  

This update focuses more on photosynthetic light-harvesting, and generalizes the derivation of the standard master equation.  

Note, HEOM parts of this code will not run at the moment, this will be fixed in the near future.
